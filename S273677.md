# Abstract

Every gas station can set their own prices of fules. Drivers choose gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice. One of the Drivers (called *administrator*) collect the price and location of each gas station, told the other driver.

One of the driver, the *hacker*, volunteers to develop a simple application to support the administrator. To keep things simple the application is standalone, and is meant to be used only by the administrator. Possibly the administrator role is taken by different drivers over time. Instead of the notebook, the hacker sets up a WhatsApp group. Whenever a gas station change the price, he update on the EZGas application.
